# Simple-SP
Simple superparameterization example in Python using the DALES model

This is a simplified superparameterization setup, where the global
model consists of only advection. The purpose of this example is
showing a lack of cloud advection in a superparameterized model, and
exploring schemes to improve cloud advection by adjusting the
small-scale variability of the total humidity in the local models.

## Installation and Use

* Install OMUSE (recommended in a virtual environment)
and the DALES model within OMUSE. See the
[OMUSE installation instructions](https://omuse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html)

* Other requirements: scipy, matplotlib, netCDF4 (`pip install netCDF4`)

* Activate the OMUSE virtual environment

```
python simple-sp.py # run simulations, 10 minutes on 4-core desktop
python plot-lwp.py  # plot result
```
